# gifLibraryUI
### UI for [gif_library](https://github.com/keithcruz/gif_library) api using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) .  The UI allows for user registration, login, and logout.  Logged in users can search for gifs and select gifs to be added on their home page.  Once added to their home page users can add categories to their gifs (called "tags" in the UI) and filter their gifs based on their tags.

### To install use at least node version 12.13.0 and npm to execute from the project directory:

```npm i```

To run use:

```npm run dev```

### Some notes on improvements to be made with more time:

- Better error handling for error messages
- Complete unit testing
- Improve the css, especially on the gifs and checkbox inputs
